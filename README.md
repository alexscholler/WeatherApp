# ðŸŒ¦ Weather App

A simple, responsive weather application that uses the **free tier** of the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display:

- **Current weather** for any city
- **Next 24 hours** (3-hour intervals)
- **Next 5 days** forecast
- **Cloud coverage** and **rain probability** charts

The app runs entirely in the browser, works on GitHub Pages, and requires no backend.
